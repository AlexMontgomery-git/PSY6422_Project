# PSY6422 Data Visualisation Project

## Overwatch Hero Pick Rate

A repository for my Data Analysis and Visualisation (PSY6422) project as part of my MSc in Psycholgoical Research Methods with Data Science. 

## Data Origin

The data was manually scraped from [overbuff.com](https://www.overbuff.com/heroes). All variables were scraped but the analysis only used the **hero** variable along with the **hero pick rate** varaibles for each of the 7 divisions.

## Project Details

The project examines the **pick rate** of different heroes across **varying levels of skill (divisions)** and set out to highlight significant trends within the data.

The project was written in **R script** using the following packages
- tidyverse version 1.3.0
- ploty version 4.9.3
- webshot version 0.5.2
- knitr version 1.31
